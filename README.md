🔍 Problem Statement

In many parts of India, rural and semi-rural women want to work to support their families, but they face multiple barriers:

Many women cannot read or write

Most job platforms are text-heavy and English-based

Strong language barriers (Telugu, Hindi, Tamil speakers)

Safety concerns when traveling to unknown locations

Fear of exploitation, fake jobs, and unsafe workplaces

Limited access to smartphones apps — mostly use voice calls or WhatsApp audio

Because of these challenges, existing job portals are not usable for this group, even though job opportunities exist nearby.

🎯 Our Solution: Voice Bridge

Voice Bridge is a voice-first AI job assistant designed specifically for illiterate and rural women.

Instead of reading or typing, users can:

Speak in their mother tongue

Ask for nearby or safe jobs

Receive voice-based guidance and job suggestions

Get safety-focused explanations, not just job listings

The system uses:

Speech-to-Text to understand voice

AI Agents to interpret intent and ensure safety

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to avoid fake or hallucinated jobs

Text-to-Speech to respond in a friendly, accessible way

👩‍🌾 Target Users

Rural / semi-rural women

Illiterate or low-literacy users

Women seeking:

Domestic work

Tailoring

Farm or local labor jobs

Users who prefer voice interaction over text

📌 Key Assumptions

To design this system realistically, we make the following assumptions:

Users own or have access to a basic smartphone

Users are comfortable speaking in their native language

Users trust voice responses more than written text

Users prefer:

Nearby jobs

Jobs where their language is spoken

Safety is more important than salary

Internet connectivity may be slow but available

Users do not want to share personal details unnecessarily

🛡️ Ethical Considerations (Early Design)

From the beginning, Voice Bridge is designed with ethics in mind:

❌ No fake or scraped job data

❌ No personal data storage

❌ No manipulation or forced migration

✅ Jobs are filtered for safety and language comfort
