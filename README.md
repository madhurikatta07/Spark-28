# Voice Bridge 🚺🎙
*Hackathon Proof of Concept (PoC)*
1. Problem Statement
In India, many rural and semi-rural women want to work and support their families but are unable to access job opportunities due to multiple real-world barriers:

* Many women are *illiterate or semi-literate* and cannot read or write
* Existing job platforms are *text-based, app-heavy, and complex*
* Lack of *local language support*
* Serious *safety concerns*, fraud, and exploitation risks
* A large number of women *do not own smartphones* and use only *basic keypad phones*

Because of these issues, rural women are excluded from nearby, small-scale job opportunities even when work is available.

*Hackathon Challenge:*

Design an AI-based solution that enables rural women to access safe job opportunities *using only voice, including support for **non-smartphone (keypad phone) users*.

2. Solution

*Voice Bridge* is a *voice-first AI assistant* built as a *hackathon Proof of Concept* to help rural women find and apply for nearby jobs by simply *speaking in their local language*.

### Key Idea

> If a woman can speak, she can get a job.

### How the Solution Works

* *Smartphone users* interact with the AI using voice
* *Keypad phone users* can *call a toll-free number* and interact with the AI through an IVR-based voice system
* No reading, typing, or app installation is required
* AI understands the user’s intent, retrieves relevant jobs, and responds with *spoken guidance*

The solution removes literacy, language, and technology barriers while prioritizing *accessibility and safety*.
